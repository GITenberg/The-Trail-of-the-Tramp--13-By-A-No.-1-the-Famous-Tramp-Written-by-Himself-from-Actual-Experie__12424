description: It is recommended the reader drink moonshine before reading this hardnosed
  edition of A No. 1's hobo story cycle, which presents cautionary tales of clueless
  youth corrupted by the road. Lessons covered include ""do unto others before they
  do unto you"" and the difference between yeggars (who steal and rob) and plingers
  (a begging class). As is the case with all A. No. 1 books, the hobo stories are
  richly illustrated with beautiful early American prints and cartoons. First published
  in 1913.
